Developed by Team Mayhem™

## Description
Chaos Engine is a C++/Opengl (later added support for Linux and Vulkan) developed by a team of 3 devs called Team Mayhem during a 5 month time period as part of a graduation project, The objective of this project was to make a Game engine from scratch using as few libraries as possible.

## Constraints
- The editor must work on Windows (Later added support for Linux).
- The engine must use a custom mathematics library.
- The engine must support OpenGL as rendering API (Later added Vulkan).
- The engine can use an existing physic library.

## My part
During the development process i was responsible for:
- Setting up an Event System/Dispatcher.
- Asset conditioning (.chaosasset).
- Low level Rendering pipeline.
- Shader creation for different types of materials.
- Lighting system.
- Camera system.
- Post processing effects (GBuffer, FXAA, Blur, etc).
- Deferred rendering pipeline.
- PingPong rendering.
- Realtime Shadows (ShadowMapping).
- PBR rendering pipeline.
- Editor creation. 
- Audio integration.

## Libraries used
- PhysX
- Assimp
- SpdLog
- OpenGL
- Qt
- FMOD

## How to Buid Chaos Engine
CMake 3.12.2 or newer is needed to complete the build.
First under ChaosEngine/Source folder run GenerateProject.bat to generate the VS solution,
this will create a build folder that will contain said solution.
Solution's output will be located at ChaosEngine/Build.

# How to Build Chaos Editor
First install Qt 5.12.0 in C:/ or specify in ChaosEditor/Source/ChaosEditor/CMakeLists.txt the Qt folder path then under ChaosEditor/Source run GenerateProject.bat to generate the VS solution, this will create a build folder that will contain said solution.
Solution's output will be located at ChaosEditor/Build.
